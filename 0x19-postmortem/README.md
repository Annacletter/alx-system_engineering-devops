0x19. Postmortem

Every software system is bound to encounter failures, which can stem from various factors like bugs, traffic spikes, security vulnerabilities, hardware malfunctions, natural calamities, or human oversight. Failure is a natural part of the process, offering invaluable opportunities for learning and advancement. It's crucial for any adept Software Engineer to glean insights from their missteps to prevent recurrence. While failure itself is acceptable, repeating the same mistake twice due to oversight is not.

In the tech industry, postmortems serve as indispensable tools. Following any system outage, the responsible team(s) compile a comprehensive summary with two primary objectives:

Providing easy-to-access information to all employees within the company regarding the cause of the outage. Since outages can significantly impact a company, it's essential for managers and executives to comprehend the incident's details and its ramifications on their operations.

Ensuring that the root cause(s) of the outage are identified and appropriate measures are implemented to prevent its recurrence.
